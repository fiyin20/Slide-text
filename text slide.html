      <h2>SLIDE IN ON SCROLL</h2>

      <p>
        The devil will try his hardest to stop you in this area of renewing the
        mind. He knows that his control over you is finished once you have
        learned to choose right thoughts and reject wrong ones. He will attempt
        to stop you through
        <img src="fi.jpg" width="300px" class="align-right slide-in" />
        discouragement and condemnation. When condemnation comes, use your "Word
        weapon." Quote Romans 8:1, reminding Satan and yourself that you do not
        walk after the flesh but after the Spirit. Walking after the flesh is
        depending on yourself; walking after the Spirit is depending on God.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you fail (which you will), that doesn't mean that you are a
        failure. It simply means that you don't do everything right. We all have
        to accept the fact that along with strengths we also have weaknesses.
        Just let Christ be strong in your weaknesses; let Him be your strength
        on your weak days. I repeat: don't receive condemnation. Your total
        victory will come, but it will take time because it will come "little by
        little."
      </p>
      <p>
        DON'T GET DISCOURAGED Why are you cast down, O my inner self? And why
        should you moan over me and be disquieted within me? Hope in God and
        wait expectantly for Him, for I shall yet praise Him, my Help and My
        God. Psalm 42:5 Discouragement destroys hope, so naturally the devil
        always tries to discourage us. Without hope we give up, which is what
        the devil wants us to do. The Bible repeatedly tells us not to be
        discouraged or dismayed.
      </p>

      <p>
        God knows that we will not come through to victory if we get
        discouraged, so He<img

        />
        always encourages us as we start out on a project by saying to us.
        "Don't get discouraged." God wants us to be encouraged, not discouraged.
        When discouragement or condemnation tries to overtake you, examine your
        thought life. What kind of thoughts have you been thinking? Have they
        sounded something like this?
      </p>

      <p>
        "I'm not going to make it; this is too hard. I always fail, it has
        always been the same, nothing ever changes. I'm sure other people don't
        have this much trouble getting their minds renewed. I may as well give
        up. I'm tired of trying. I pray, but it seems as if God doesn't hear.
        <img src="2.jpg" width="300px" class="align-left slide-in" /> He
        probably doesn't answer my prayers because He is so disappointed in the
        way I act." If this example represents your thoughts, it is no wonder
        you get discouraged or come under condemnation. Remember, you become
        what you think. Think discouraging thoughts, and you'll get discouraged.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had a rough day yesterday. Think condemning thoughts, and you'll come
        under condemnation. Change your thinking and be set free! Instead of
        thinking negatively, think like this: "Well, things are going a little
        slow; but, thank God, I'm making some progress. I'm sure glad I'm on the
        right path that will lead me to freedom.I chose wrong thinking all day
        long. Father, forgive me, and help me to 'keep on keeping on.' I made a
        mistake, but at least that is one mistake I won't have to make again.
        This is a new day. You love me, Lord. Your mercy is new every morning
